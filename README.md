# Implementing a Preemptive Task Scheduler on ARM Cortex-M4

A bare-metal **preemptive task scheduler** implemented from scratch on an **ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller** (STM32).
This project builds a **mini-RTOS-like kernel** without using FreeRTOS or any external libraries â€” handling **task management, context switching, and scheduling** entirely through manual stack manipulation and exception handling.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design and implement a **round-robin preemptive scheduler** capable of running multiple independent tasks with context preservation.
Each user task has its own stack, state, and delay mechanism, allowing efficient CPU utilization similar to a real-time operating system (RTOS).

The system uses:

* **SysTick** timer interrupts to generate periodic ticks (1 ms),
* **PendSV** exceptions for context switching,
* **PSP/MSP** stack pointer separation for user and kernel modes,
* **Task Control Blocks (TCBs)** to track task states and stack pointers.

---

## Features

* **Round-Robin Preemptive Scheduling**
  All tasks share CPU time equally, managed via SysTick interrupts and PendSV exceptions.

* **Task Control Block (TCB) Architecture**
  Each task maintains its own private stack, program counter, and state (Ready / Blocked).

* **Timer-Based Task Delay (Blocking Mechanism)**
  Tasks can voluntarily yield the CPU for a defined duration (`task_delay()`), improving efficiency.

* **Idle Task Implementation**
  Runs only when all user tasks are blocked â€” useful for low-power modes.

* **Context Switching**
  Fully manual saving and restoring of registers (R4-R11 + stack frame) during task switches.

* **LED Blinking Demonstration**
  Four LEDs toggle at independent rates, showcasing parallel task scheduling behavior.

## System Architecture

**Core Components:**

* `main.c` â€” Initializes system stack, SysTick, tasks, and context switching routines. (conceptually integrated) â€” Scheduler, PendSV handler, SysTick handler, delay and unblocking logic.
* `led.c / led.h` â€” Peripheral control for LEDs (GPIO configuration and toggling).

**Execution Flow:**

1. Initialize processor faults and SysTick timer (1 ms tick).
2. Create and initialize stacks for all tasks.
3. Switch from **MSP (Main Stack Pointer)** to **PSP (Process Stack Pointer)**.
4. Enter task handler for the first task.
5. SysTick triggers periodic PendSV exceptions â†’ scheduler decides the next ready task.

## Task Demonstration

| Task      | LED Color | Blink Rate | Description                               |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Task-1    | Green     | 1 s        | Toggles every second                      |
| Task-2    | Orange    | 0.5 s      | Toggles twice per second                  |
| Task-3    | Blue      | 0.25 s     | Fast blink                                |
| Task-4    | Red       | 0.125 s    | Rapid blink                               |
| Idle Task | â€”         | â€”          | Executes when all other tasks are blocked |

Each LEDâ€™s toggle pattern verifies successful scheduling and context switching.
